<p>I'm Jeroen Rijks, a DevOps engineer based in London, UK. After completing my Chemistry Masters degree at the University of Oxford in 2018, I moved to London to pursue a career in tech. I'm going to use this blog as a place to document my thoughts, and maybe share some of my learning with the internet.</p>

<p>Besides tech, I like playing music and eating large quantities of food.</p>
