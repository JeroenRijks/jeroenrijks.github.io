<p>I started my career as a backend developer for a technical consultancy called <a href="https://www.solirius.com">Solirius Consulting</a>. After a year of learning on the job, supplemented with dedicated learning in a supportive environment, I built up enough experience with Java, Python, and various DevOps tools, to call myself a competent software engineer. However, the most important things that I learned at Solirius are:</p>
<li><a href="/link_to_headphones_on/off">the importance of good communication skills</a></li>
<li>an understanding of how to work with other people</li>
<li>what I want my career to look like</li>

<p>At Solirius, I worked on <a href="www.moj.com/reform">a large-scale project with the Ministry of Justice</a>, where our microservice team provided utility APIs to many other microservice teams. A centralised platform engineering team provided a platform for each microservice to deploy onto, and was following the industry-wide trend to host microservices on Kubernetes. Since I was given a lot of freedom to select my own tasks, I took on all of our Kubernetes tasks, and subsequently learnt my way around Kubernetes, Helm, Azure and Jenkins. </p>

<p> After learning more about DevOps, I realised that despite spending so much time with Kubernetes, I still didn't feel like I had any ownership of what I had created. It was this, combined with the desire to become a Kubernetes god, that made me decide to leave my comfortable job at Solirius, with a clear idea of what I wanted to find.</p>

<p> In September 2019, I joined <a href="www.transreport.co.uk">TransReport</a>, a small startup working on an awesome product, Passenger Assist. Working with some amazing people in our London, Glasgow and Romanian offices, we have created a system that will help rail companies to provide assistance to disabled travellers throughout the UK. Simply put, my role is as follows: developers give me an app, and I make sure that it runs properly. My work prioritises the reliability, security, scalability, and MORE of our APIs, caches and databases.</p>
