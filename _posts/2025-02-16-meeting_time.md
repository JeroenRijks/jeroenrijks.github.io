### Obtaining requirements

- clarifying and establishing requirements
- changing requirements

### Should we split the responsibility?

Benefits
- separation of skills lets people do what they're best at
  - devs spend more time developing
  - people people spend more time people-ing
- technical and non-technical team members "practice" communicating with each other, since they're a constant "interface" (BA) between them and the client
  - this ends up making a team "gel" well together
- more people and skill diversity allows teams to "share the load"

Drawbacks
- Two communication interfaces 
  - slower
  - scope for miscommunication
- More team members = more $$$ spent

### When do developers attend meetings?

A lot of meeting-bashing developers would say that ideally, developers only attend meetings to have technical conversations with technical members of the client's team. However, scrum methodology can take up hours per week on sprint planning, retrospectives, demos and stand-ups.

While losing time to meetings can be frustrating to a busy team with looming deadlines, it may give developers a higher-level overview of the project, and a better understanding of how their work fits into that. When I was working on HMCTS's Evidence Management project, gaining this understanding helped me value and enjoy my work more, and made me read user stories within a more accurate context.
